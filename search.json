    "text": "Power 5 basketball teams focus on making March Madness. For this evaluation, the Power 5 includes the ACC, Big East, Big 12, Big 10, and SEC. The Pac-12 is also included from 2022-2024 (R.I.P.). The season is made up of 31 regular-season games. Depending on the conference, teams have either 11 or 13 games to schedule to strengthen their tournament resumes. Coaching staffs adopt different philosophies when choosing their opponents.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(pscl)\np5 &lt;- read_csv(\"POWER 5 NON-CON QUAD BREAKDOWN.csv\")\n\nbama &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(TEAM == \"Alabama\")\nminn &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(TEAM == \"Minnesota\")\ngtown &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(TEAM == \"Georgetown\")\nunc &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(TEAM == \"North Carolina\")\npurdue &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(TEAM == \"Purdue\")\nnw &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(TEAM == \"Northwestern\")\nprov &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(TEAM == \"Providence\")\n\nggplot() + \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-15, 15)) +\n  geom_line(data=p5, aes(x=SEASON, y=NCSOS, group=TEAM), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_line(data=bama, aes(x=SEASON, y=NCSOS, group=TEAM), color=\"#9E1B32\") +\n  geom_line(data=minn, aes(x=SEASON, y=NCSOS, group=TEAM), color=\"#FFC627\") +\n  geom_line(data=gtown, aes(x=SEASON, y=NCSOS, group=TEAM), color=\"#041E42\") +\n  geom_line(data=unc, aes(x=SEASON, y=NCSOS, group=TEAM), color=\"#007FAE\") +\n  geom_line(data=purdue, aes(x=SEASON, y=NCSOS, group=TEAM), color=\"#CFB991\") +\n  geom_line(data=nw, aes(x=SEASON, y=NCSOS, group=TEAM), color=\"#4E2A84\") +\n  geom_line(data=prov, aes(x=SEASON, y=NCSOS, group=TEAM), color=\"#8a8d8f\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2022.5, y=11.5, label=\"Alabama\", colour=\"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2024, y=-14, label=\"Minnesota\", colour=\"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2024.75, y=-12.5, label=\"Georgetown\", colour=\"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2024.75, y=14.25, label=\"North Carolina\", colour=\"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2024, y=11.5, label=\"Purdue\", colour=\"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2022.25, y=-11.5, label=\"Northwestern\", colour=\"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2023, y=-10, label=\"Providence\", colour=\"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Power 5 Teams Schedule Similarily from Year to Year\",\n       subtitle = \"Focusing on the easiest and hardest schedule each year.\",\n       caption = \"Source: KenPom | By Simon Kerr\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 19, face =\"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeams like North Carolina and Alabama, led by Hubert Davis and Nate Oats, respectively, have some of the toughest schedules year after year. Others, like Minnesota and Northwestern, have much easier non-conference opponents. These different approaches can both lead to tournament appearances. Tougher schedules allow for more losses because opponents are better. North Carolina went 7-5 out of conference in 2025, playing the hardest non-conference schedule of any Power 5 team. Half of their opponents were in the first quadrant of the NCAA Evaluation Tool (NET) rankings. After a mediocre non-conference performance, the Tar Heels finished ACC play with a 13-7 record, tied for fourth. Ultimately, North Carolina made the NCAA Tournament, proving that a tough out-of-conference schedule with multiple losses was a successful formula.\nThe opposite strategy is less forgiving. In 2025, Georgetown, led by Ed Cooley, went 9-2 out of conference, playing the easiest schedule of all Power 5 teams. While North Carolina packed their schedule with quadrant one games, Georgetown played eight quadrant four games. The Hoyas then went 8-12 in the Big East, leading to a seventh-place finish in the conference. An overall record of 17-14 with weak non-conference opponents resulted in Cooley’s team missing March Madness. Fewer opportunities for big wins hurt Georgetown when they had a poor conference performance.\nTo determine the most important factors for making the NCAA Tournament, a multiple binomial logistic regression was created. Nine potential variables were available to the model. After using a stepwise selection process, five variables were selected: conference winning percentage, non-conference winning percentage, and the number of games in quadrants one, two, and four. These chosen variables are the most important factors in determining if a team receives an at-large bid. The model created states that a team receiving an at-large bid is 75% explained by these five variables. The formula for the model is:\n-34.9273 + 23.3126*(Conference Winning Percentage) + 19.5297*(Non-Conference Winning Percentage) + 1.3951*(Q1 Games) + 1.1434*(Q2 Games) + .4345*(Q4 Games).\nComparing the different teams would be challenging, so instead, the non-conference winning percentage was used as a predictor for the probability of a team receiving an at-large bid. Since there are multiple variables, the others must be held constant to demonstrate the effect of non-conference winning percentage. This factor was chosen because teams can construct their out-of-conference schedules to increase their winning percentage. Teams have no control over their opponents during conference play. Using the average from the dataset, this new model assumes a team goes .500 in conference play, and plays 3 quadrant 1 games, 2 quadrant 2 games, and 6 quadrant 4 games.\n\n\nCode\n#Changing Y and N

But dropping 4 games decreases the probability of receiving an at-large bid below 15%.\nAfter examining all of these moving parts, how have recent bubble teams stood out to the selection committee?\n\n\nCode\n#Changing binomial values back to Y and N\np5$AT_LARGE_BID &lt;- ifelse(p5$AT_LARGE_BID == 1, \"Y\", \"N\")\n#Chaning prediction to a percentage\np5$pred &lt;- paste(p5$pred*100, \"%\")\n\nout_2025 &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(SEASON == 2025, TEAM %in% c(\"West Virginia\", \"Indiana\", \"Ohio State\"))\nout_2024 &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(SEASON == 2024, TEAM %in% c(\"Oklahoma\", \"Seton Hall\", \"Pittsburgh\"))\nout_2023 &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(SEASON == 2023, TEAM %in% c(\"Oklahoma State\", \"Rutgers\", \"North Carolina\", \"Clemson\"))\nout_2022 &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(SEASON == 2022, TEAM %in% c(\"Oklahoma\", \"Texas A&M\"))\nin_2025 &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(SEASON == 2025, TEAM %in% c(\"North Carolina\", \"Texas\", \"Xavier\"))\nin_2024 &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(SEASON == 2024, TEAM %in% c(\"Colorado\", \"Virginia\"))\nin_2023 &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(SEASON == 2023, TEAM %in% c(\"Mississippi State\", \"Pittsburgh\", \"Arizona State\"))\nin_2022 &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(SEASON == 2022, TEAM %in% c(\"Indiana\", \"Notre Dame\", \"Rutgers\"))\n\nbubble_2025 &lt;- bind_rows(in_2025, out_2025)\nbubble_2024 &lt;- bind_rows(in_2024, out_2024)\nbubble_2023 &lt;- bind_rows(in_2023, out_2023)\nbubble_2022 &lt;- bind_rows(in_2022, out_2022)\n\ncombined &lt;- bind_rows(bubble_2025, bubble_2024, bubble_2023, bubble_2022) |&gt; \n  select(!AVG_OPP_NET_RK)\n\ncombined |&gt;\n  group_by(SEASON) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(NCWIN_PCT = \"NCWIN%\", CONF_WIN_PCT = \"CONF WIN%\", ROAD_NEUTRAL = \"ROAD/NEUTRAL\",\n             AT_LARGE_BID = \"AT LARGE BID\", pred = \"MODEL CHANCE TO RECEIVE AT-LARGE BID\") |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How do Bubble Teams Separate Themselves?\",\n    subtitle = \"Each team's resume tells the story about their season\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"blue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = AT_LARGE_BID == \"Y\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Simon Kerr  |  **Source:** WarrenNolan, KenPom & ESPN\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do Bubble Teams Separate Themselves?\n\n\nEach team's resume tells the story about their season\n\n\nTEAM\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nNCSOS\nNCWIN%\nCONF WIN%\nROAD/NEUTRAL\nAT LARGE BID\nMODEL CHANCE TO RECEIVE AT-LARGE BID\n\n\n\n\n2025\n\n\nNorth Carolina\n6\n1\n1\n4\n13.40\n0.583\n0.650\n7\nY\n95 %\n\n\nTexas\n1\n3\n2\n7\n-8.10\n0.846\n0.333\n4\nY\n6 %\n\n\nXavier\n2\n3\n0\n6\n-1.10\n0.727\n0.650\n4\nY\n96 %\n\n\nOhio State\n4\n1\n0\n6\n3.22\n0.727\n0.450\n4\nN\n29 %\n\n\nWest Virginia\n4\n0\n2\n5\n0.98\n0.818\n0.500\n4\nN\n61 %\n\n\nIndiana\n2\n1\n4\n4\n1.50\n0.818\n0.500\n3\nN\n16 %\n\n\n2024\n\n\nColorado\n1\n2\n2\n6\n-1.47\n0.818\n0.650\n4\nY\n92 %\n\n\nVirginia\n3\n1\n2\n5\n-1.09\n0.818\n0.650\n4\nY\n98 %\n\n\nPittsburgh\n1\n0\n4\n6\n-6.46\n0.818\n0.600\n3\nN\n28 %\n\n\nOklahoma\n1\n3\n1\n8\n-5.38\n0.923\n0.444\n4\nN\n85 %\n\n\nSeton Hall\n1\n2\n2\n6\n-1.47\n0.636\n0.650\n4\nN\n26 %\n\n\n2023\n\n\nMississippi State\n2\n2\n2\n7\n-3.89\n0.923\n0.444\n6\nY\n83 %\n\n\nArizona State\n1\n3\n1\n6\n0.78\n0.818\n0.550\n6\nY\n79 %\n\n\nPittsburgh\n2\n3\n0\n6\n-2.73\n0.636\n0.700\n4\nY\n93 %\n\n\nRutgers\n1\n0\n4\n6\n-7.51\n0.727\n0.500\n2\nN\n1 %\n\n\nOklahoma State\n1\n3\n4\n5\n0.46\n0.692\n0.444\n6\nN\n2 %\n\n\nNorth Carolina\n3\n3\n3\n2\n6.63\n0.727\n0.550\n6\nN\n64 %\n\n\nClemson\n1\n1\n3\n6\n-5.75\n0.727\n0.700\n5\nN\n68 %\n\n\n2022\n\n\nIndiana\n1\n2\n0\n7\n-6.23\n0.900\n0.450\n2\nY\n47 %\n\n\nNotre Dame\n5\n0\n0\n5\n2.70\n0.600\n0.750\n5\nY\n97 %\n\n\nRutgers\n1\n1\n2\n6\n-10.43\n0.600\n0.600\n3\nY\n2 %\n\n\nTexas A&M\n3\n0\n2\n7\n-5.58\n0.833\n0.500\n5\nN\n56 %\n\n\nOklahoma\n2\n3\n2\n6\n-2.04\n0.769\n0.389\n6\nN\n12 %\n\n\n\nBy: Simon Kerr | Source: WarrenNolan, KenPom & ESPN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2025 North Carolina team is present here again. The model clearly believes this team should have made the NCAA Tournament. The Tar Heels made up for their mediocre non-conference record with an above-average conference performance. The outliers are interesting in this table. In 2025, Texas was the third-to-last team selected to the field. The model gives them only a 6% chance of making the tournament. If the conference winning percentage is the only factor, then they should not make March Madness. Taking a step back, Texas is in the SEC, which had the most dominant conference in college basketball history last season. While their winning percentage was very low, the selection committee believed the quality of their opponents was more important than their record.\nThe other big outlier is Rutgers in 2022. This team was given a 2% chance of making March Madness! Once again, the model examines the mediocre winning percentages combined with the lack of quadrant one and two games. A 6-4 non-conference record with the second weakest schedule of Power 5 teams? No way this team should make the tournament. However, the selection committee included Rutgers in the tournament that year because of its wins in conference play. They had multiple wins against ranked teams, making them a tournament team in the committee’s eyes.\nUsing the model moving forward, teams may benefit from weaker non-conference schedules if they believe they will be above average in conference play. However, a tougher conference may require a team to schedule tougher teams to bolster their resume for the NCAA tournament. In the end, the number of games a team wins is the most important factor for a team to play in the postseason. Teams can use their non-conference schedules to achieve higher win totals or improve the quality of their opponents."
