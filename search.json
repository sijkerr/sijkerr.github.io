    "section": "",
    "text": "Their is often conversation surrounding the best NFL teams of all time. Fans have something to be proud of and brag about to friends and family. In turn, making fun of someone for having the worst NFL team of all time could be even more enjoyable. Kerry Miller published this article for Bleacher Report in 2020 discussing the 10 worst teams in NFL history. Miller was generous, leaving out teams within the first three years a team came into the league. This eliminates the 1976 Buccaneers and the 1967 Falcons. He also did not list a franchise more than twice. Another notable omission were the winless 2008 Lions. Unlike Miller, this only includes Super Bowl Era teams. This also only examines the seasons listed by Miller and adding the seasons of the omitted teams above (no mercy here). That gives 10 seasons to look at. Is one of the winless teams in the Super Bowl Era the worst NFL team of all time?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nstats &lt;- read_csv(\"Worst Team Stats.csv\")\n\nno_wins &lt;- stats |&gt; filter(Wins == 0)\ntwenty_worst &lt;- stats |&gt; filter(PointDifferential &lt;= -171)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=twenty_worst, aes(x=reorder(Team, -PointDifferential), weight=PointDifferential)) +\n  geom_bar(data=no_wins, aes(x=reorder(Team, -PointDifferential), weight=PointDifferential), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"The 1976 Buccaneers have the worst point differential\",\n       subtitle = \"They only played fourteen games and were still the worst.\",\n       caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Simon Kerr\",\n       x = \"Team\",\n       y = \"Point Differential\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 19, face =\"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading the way, the 1976 Buccaneers have the worst point differential in NFL history at an astounding -287! To make it worse, the regular season consisted of only 14 games at the time. That means the Bucs were losing games by an average of nearly 21 points! The other winless teams are notably in the top 20 of worst scoring differential for the 10 seasons.\nPoint differential does not mean everything because teams may play harder schedules than others. To examine which teams performed worse with an easier schedule, Strength of Schedule (SOS) can be used. Pro Football Reference states, “Strength of Schedule indicates the combined winning percentages of the opponents this team played in a given year.” So a higher SOS, the tougher the schedule and vice versa. Maybe the 1976 Buccaneers just had a tough schedule.\n\n\nCode\nbad &lt;- twenty_worst |&gt; filter(StrengthOfSchedule &lt;= -.8 & PointDifferential &lt;= -225)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=twenty_worst, aes(x=StrengthOfSchedule, y=PointDifferential)) +\n  geom_point(data=no_wins, aes(x=StrengthOfSchedule, y=PointDifferential), colour=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=no_wins, aes(x=StrengthOfSchedule, y=PointDifferential, label=Team)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=bad, aes(x=StrengthOfSchedule, y=PointDifferential, label=Team)) +\n  labs(title = \"Winless teams have tougher schedules\",\n       subtitle = \"Having an easier schedule with a worse point differential is concerning.\",\n       caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Simon Kerr\",\n       x = \"Strength of Schedule\",\n       y = \"Point Differential\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 19, face =\"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to the terrible point differential teams, the Bucs had a tougher schedule than most. All three winless teams had average or above average SOSs. So their opponents factored in to their disappointing seasons. Considering the strength of schedule aspect, the 2009 Rams, the 1991 Colts, and the 1986 Buccaneers enter the picture as awful teams. These three teams have the fourth, twelfth, and fifteenth worst point differentials in NFL history respectively. So they are outstanding candidates to be the worst team in NFL history. Miller also has these teams in his top 10 of worst teams.\nSOS helps explain why some teams SOS is so bad, but it also displays that these Colts and Rams teams were very bad. To help determine how bad a team truly is, the Simple Rating System (SRS) can be used. According to Pro Football Reference, “SRS is a rating that takes into account average point differential and strength of schedule.” So by combining the last two metrics used, a new stat can quantify how bad a team is. Another way to think of SRS could be a point spread. For example, the 1976 Buccaneers SRS is -19.7. That means the Bucs would be almost 20 point underdogs to an average team in 1976. Now to compare across seasons, z-scores will be used.\n\n\nCode\nstatswseason &lt;- stats |&gt; \n  separate(Team, into=c(\"Season\", \"Team\"), sep=\" \")\n\nzscore &lt;- statswseason |&gt; \n  group_by(Season) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    SimpleRatingSystemzscore = as.numeric(scale(SimpleRatingSystem, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE))\n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(SimpleRatingSystemzscore) |&gt; \n  select(Team, Wins, Losses, Ties, PointDifferential, SimpleRatingSystemzscore)\n\nfullzscore &lt;- zscore |&gt; \n  unite(Team, Season, Team, sep=\" \") |&gt; \n  head(15)\n\nfullzscore |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(PointDifferential = \"Point Differential\", SimpleRatingSystemzscore = \"Simple Rating System Z-Score\") |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How do these disappointing teams compare across seasons?\",\n    subtitle = \"Within the context of their season, the 1986 Buccaneers were way below their competition.\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Wins == 0)\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Simon Kerr  |  **Source:** Pro Football Reference\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do these disappointing teams compare across seasons?\n\n\nWithin the context of their season, the 1986 Buccaneers were way below their competition.\n\n\nTeam\nWins\nLosses\nTies\nPoint Differential\nSimple Rating System Z-Score\n\n\n\n\n1986 Buccaneers\n2\n14\n0\n-234\n-2.575669\n\n\n1990 Patriots\n1\n15\n0\n-265\n-2.435333\n\n\n1991 Colts\n1\n15\n0\n-238\n-2.427438\n\n\n2009 Rams\n1\n15\n0\n-261\n-2.378783\n\n\n2008 Rams\n2\n14\n0\n-233\n-2.300124\n\n\n1976 Buccaneers\n0\n14\n0\n-287\n-2.247836\n\n\n1990 Browns\n3\n13\n0\n-234\n-2.168382\n\n\n1973 Oilers\n1\n13\n0\n-248\n-2.082320\n\n\n2008 Lions\n0\n16\n0\n-249\n-1.995472\n\n\n2009 Lions\n2\n14\n0\n-232\n-1.968722\n\n\n1966 Giants\n1\n12\n1\n-238\n-1.948598\n\n\n1967 Falcons\n1\n12\n1\n-247\n-1.912640\n\n\n2017 Browns\n0\n16\n0\n-176\n-1.837867\n\n\n1966 Falcons\n3\n11\n0\n-233\n-1.797874\n\n\n1986 Colts\n3\n13\n0\n-171\n-1.739219\n\n\n\nBy: Simon Kerr | Source: Pro Football Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven when standardizing across the seasons, the three teams just mentioned are in the top four of the list. The 1990 Patriots are there too, but a SOS of 2.0 justifies their point differential. Notably, the winless teams are not at the top of this list. This could mean that the point differentials of those seasons were all mediocre.\nMiller lists the 1990 Patriots as his worst Super Bowl Era team, but clearly their SOS contributed to their 15 loss season. Looking across all three charts, the 2009 Rams jump out as the worst team. The fourth worst point differential of all time combined with a relatively easy schedule makes their one win look pitiful. The Rams are Miller’s second worst Super Bowl Era team, so there is a case for the worst.\nHowever, the winless teams in NFL history will be remembered for their records. From the outside looking in, they may seem like the worst teams ever. Their SOS and context within their respective seasons say otherwise."

    "text": "Power 5 basketball teams focus on making March Madness. For this evaluation, the Power 5 includes the ACC, Big East, Big 12, Big 10, and SEC. The Pac-12 is also included from 2022-2024 (R.I.P.). The season is made up of 31 regular-season games. Depending on the conference, teams have either 11 or 13 games to schedule to strengthen their tournament resumes. Coaching staffs adopt different philosophies when choosing their opponents.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(pscl)\np5 &lt;- read_csv(\"POWER 5 NON-CON QUAD BREAKDOWN.csv\")\n\nbama &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(TEAM == \"Alabama\")\nminn &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(TEAM == \"Minnesota\")\ngtown &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(TEAM == \"Georgetown\")\nunc &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(TEAM == \"North Carolina\")\npurdue &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(TEAM == \"Purdue\")\nnw &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(TEAM == \"Northwestern\")\nprov &lt;- p5 |&gt; filter(TEAM == \"Providence\")\n\nggplot() + \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-15, 15)) +\n  geom_line(data=p5, aes(x=SEASON, y=NCSOS, group=TEAM), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_line(data=bama, aes(x=SEASON, y=NCSOS, group=TEAM), color=\"#9E1B32\") +\n  geom_line(data=minn, aes(x=SEASON, y=NCSOS, group=TEAM), color=\"#FFC627\") +\n  geom_line(data=gtown, aes(x=SEASON, y=NCSOS, group=TEAM), color=\"#041E42\") +\n  geom_line(data=unc, aes(x=SEASON, y=NCSOS, group=TEAM), color=\"#007FAE\") +\n  geom_line(data=purdue, aes(x=SEASON, y=NCSOS, group=TEAM), color=\"#CFB991\") +\n  geom_line(data=nw, aes(x=SEASON, y=NCSOS, group=TEAM), color=\"#4E2A84\") +\n  geom_line(data=prov, aes(x=SEASON, y=NCSOS, group=TEAM), color=\"#8a8d8f\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2022.5, y=11.5, label=\"Alabama\", colour=\"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2024, y=-14, label=\"Minnesota\", colour=\"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2024.75, y=-12.5, label=\"Georgetown\", colour=\"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2024.75, y=14.25, label=\"North Carolina\", colour=\"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2024, y=11.5, label=\"Purdue\", colour=\"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2022.25, y=-11.5, label=\"Northwestern\", colour=\"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2023, y=-10, label=\"Providence\", colour=\"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Power 5 Teams Schedule Similarily from Year to Year\",\n       subtitle = \"Focusing on the easiest and hardest schedule each year.\",\n       caption = \"Source: KenPom | By Simon Kerr\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 19, face =\"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeams like North Carolina and Alabama, led by Hubert Davis and Nate Oats, respectively, have some of the toughest schedules year after year. Others, like Minnesota and Northwestern, have much easier non-conference opponents. These different approaches can both lead to tournament appearances. Tougher schedules allow for more losses because opponents are better. North Carolina went 7-5 out of conference in 2025, playing the hardest non-conference schedule of any Power 5 team. Half of their opponents were in the first quadrant of the NCAA Evaluation Tool (NET) rankings. After a mediocre non-conference performance, the Tar Heels finished ACC play with a 13-7 record, tied for fourth. Ultimately, North Carolina made the NCAA Tournament, proving that a tough out-of-conference schedule with multiple losses was a successful formula.\nThe opposite strategy is less forgiving. In 2025, Georgetown, led by Ed Cooley, went 9-2 out of conference, playing the easiest schedule of all Power 5 teams. While North Carolina packed their schedule with quadrant one games, Georgetown played eight quadrant four games. The Hoyas then went 8-12 in the Big East, leading to a seventh-place finish in the conference. An overall record of 17-14 with weak non-conference opponents resulted in Cooley’s team missing March Madness. Fewer opportunities for big wins hurt Georgetown when they had a poor conference performance.\nTo determine the most important factors for making the NCAA Tournament, a multiple binomial logistic regression was created. Nine potential variables were available to the model. After using a stepwise selection process, five variables were selected: conference winning percentage, non-conference winning percentage, and the number of games in quadrants one, two, and four. These chosen variables are the most important factors in determining if a team receives an at-large bid. The model created states that a team receiving an at-large bid is 75% explained by these five variables. The formula for the model is:\n-34.9273 + 23.3126*(Conference Winning Percentage) + 19.5297*(Non-Conference Winning Percentage) + 1.3951*(Q1 Games) + 1.1434*(Q2 Games) + .4345*(Q4 Games).\nComparing the different teams would be challenging, so instead, the non-conference winning percentage was used as a predictor for the probability of a team receiving an at-large bid. Since there are multiple variables, the others must be held constant to demonstrate the effect of non-conference winning percentage. This factor was chosen because teams can construct their out-of-conference schedules to increase their winning percentage. Teams have no control over their opponents during conference play. Using the average from the dataset, this new model assumes a team goes .500 in conference play, and plays 3 quadrant 1 games, 2 quadrant 2 games, and 6 quadrant 4 games.\n\n\nCode\n#Changing Y and N

Going undefeated in non-conference play almost guarantees an at-large bid, according to the model used.

The model clearly believes this team should have made the NCAA Tournament. The Tar Heels made up for their mediocre non-conference record with an above-average conference performance. The outliers are interesting in this table. In 2025, Texas was the third-to-last team selected to the field. The model gives them only a 6% chance of making the tournament. If the conference winning percentage is the only factor, then they should not make March Madness. Taking a step back, Texas is in the SEC, which had the most dominant conference in college basketball history last season. While their winning percentage was very low, the selection committee believed the quality of their opponents was more important than their record.\nThe other big outlier is Rutgers in 2022. This team was given a 2% chance of making March Madness! Once again, the model examines the mediocre winning percentages combined with the lack of quadrant one and two games. A 6-4 non-conference record with the second weakest schedule of Power 5 teams? No way this team should make the tournament. However, the selection committee included Rutgers in the tournament that year because of its wins in conference play. They had multiple wins against ranked teams, making them a tournament team in the committee’s eyes.\nUsing the model moving forward, teams may benefit from weaker non-conference schedules if they believe they will be above average in conference play. However, a tougher conference may require a team to schedule tougher teams to bolster their resume for the NCAA tournament. In the end, the number of games a team wins is the most important factor for a team to play in the postseason. Teams can use their non-conference schedules to achieve higher win totals or improve the quality of their opponents."
